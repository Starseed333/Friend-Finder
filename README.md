# **Friend-Finder**


### **Description**

A application that implements friend matching based on the user's responses to a ten question questionnaire. The user is given the option to select from 1(Strongly Disagree) to 5(Strongly Agree). The site will take in results from the user's surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The questionnaire is then cleared after submission. 

The application also has a link which allows the user to see their potential matches as well as their own answers to the questionnaire once submitted.
